Create a program that creates an array with N integers
(N must be used in the range [0, 1 000 000], whose
the elements have an absolute value of less than or equal to 1,000,000.
Find the indices for the largest size of its products, which are smaller
or equal to a completely positive number X.
If such an index is not present, the value of N will be returned.
